# mongoose-encryption
This project have implementation of one of the npm package mongoose with password encryption. 

Password encryption is a level-2 encryption process in any user auth project. 
Mongoose is a very powerful pacakage on npm which allow developer to easily connect to mongodb database with our project.
Mongoose comes with another npm pacakage called "mongoose-encryption", which allow developer to encrypt user's credentials and 
store encrypted value in database. 

Here, in this project I had also implemented package called "dotenv". dotenv allow programmer to keep their screet file hidden, like files contains 
API_KEY and many more screte file.
